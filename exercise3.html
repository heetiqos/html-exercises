    <h1> You Give Me Something </h1>
    <p> <i> Lyrics </i></p>
    <div> <p> You want to stay with me in the morning
        <br> You only hold me when I sleep
        <br> I was meant to tread the water
        <br> Now I've gotten in too deep
        <br> For every piece of me that wants you
        <br> Another piece backs away </p> </div>
    
    <span> <p> 'Cause you give me something
        <br> That makes me scared, alright
        <br> This could be nothing
        <br> But I'm willing to give it a try
        <br> Please give me something
        <br> 'Cause someday I might know my heart </p> </span>   

    <span> <p> You already waited up for hours
        <br> Just to spend a little time alone with me
        <br> And I can say I've never bought you flowers
        <br> I can't work out what they mean
        <br> I never thought that I'd love someone
        <br> That was someone else's dream </p> </span>

     <div> <p> 'Cause you give me something
        <br> That makes me scared, alright
        <br> This could be nothing
        <br> But I'm willing to give it a try
        <br> Please give me something
        <br> 'Cause someday I might call you from my heart </p> </div> 
        
    <div> <p> But it might me a second too late
        <br> And the words that I could never say
        <br> Gonna come out anyway </p> </div>    
        
    <span> <p> 'Cause you give me something
        <br> That makes me scared, alright
        <br> This could be nothing
        <br> But I'm willing to give it a try
        <br> Please give me something </p> </span>

    <div> <p> 'Cause you give me something
        <br> That makes me scared, alright
        <br> This could be nothing
        <br> But I'm willing to give it a try
        <br> Please give me something
        <br> Cause someday I might know my heart
        <br> Know my heart, know my heart, know my heart </p> </div>
