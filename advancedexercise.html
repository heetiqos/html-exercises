    <h1>The Silliest Teacher in School</h1>
    <p> <sup> Poem by Darell Sardelli </sup> </p>
    <div>
      <p>Our teacher gave detention
       <br> to the fountains in the hall.
        <br>She handed extra homework
       <br> to the artwork on the wall.</p>  
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>We saw her point a finger
          <br> at a banner and a sign.
           <br>She said their bad behavior
          <br> was completely out of line.
        </p>
    </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>The principal approached her
        <br>   and said, “What is all this fuss?
          <br>  I heard you tried to punish
           <br> all the tires on a bus.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>“You made the teachers angry
         <br>   by disrupting all their classes,
          <br>  so if you want to keep this job,
          <br>  you have to wear your glasses!”

        </p>
